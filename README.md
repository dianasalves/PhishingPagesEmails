# PhishingPagesEmails

   
   The practical work consists of reproducing a cyber threat. In this case, the chosen threat was Phishing. Therefore, one of the objectives of this work is to carry 
out a phishing attack, with the purposes: to raise awareness about these types of threats and how simple it is; and anyone, with the right tools, can carry out this 
type of attack.
   The links that relate to the phishing attack are not available online, as the intention of this practical work is solely for academic/educational purposes and to raise
awareness about this problem that has been increasing since the pandemic began.
  Additionally, the information contained in this work must be used for EDUCATIONAL and NON-MALICIOUS purposes, since phishing is a crime! The tests that were made 
through this application to test it, had the due authorization of the victims.
  
  Software Used:
    - Email Server: Visual Studio 2022
    - Phishing Pages: NetBeans IDE 14
    - XAMPP which plays an essential role in providing the Apache server, where one of the supported languages is php.
  
  The page used in this attack example was the SIDE login page.
  
  Instructions:
    1) Start the Apache service in XAMPP
    2) Enter an email on the command line. In case there is more than one email separated by ";"
    3) Go to email inbox and open received email
    4) Clicking the URL of the phishing page in the email
    5) Enter data in the fields and submit the form
    6) Open the "credentials" .txt file and verify that the entered data has been saved in the file.
  
  Again, this work is for EDUCATIONAL purposes and MUST NOT BE USED FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES!
